# Notes App 📝

### Task 🎯

Create a simple notes app that allows users to add, edit, and delete notes. Here are the tasks you need to complete:
1. Create an "Add Note" button on the right part of the page and when it is clicked a new note section should appear on the right part of the page. The new note section should have fields for the user to enter the title and content of the note.
2. When the user clicks the "Enter" key in the new note section, the note should be added to the list of notes displayed on the left part of the page. 
3. Add a "Delete" button to each note in the list. When the "Delete" button is clicked, the corresponding note should be removed from the list.
4. When the user clicks on a note in the list, the full details of the note should be displayed on the right part of the page. The full details should include both the title and content of the note.
5. When the note is clicked, the user should be able to edit the title and content of the note. 
6. All notes should be stored in local storage so that they are retained even after the page is refreshed or closed.

**Bonus Tasks (Optional)**:
1. Add a feature to search for notes based on their titles or content.
2. Implement a dark mode feature for the app.
3. Allow users to change the order of the notes in the list (e.g., by drag and drop).
